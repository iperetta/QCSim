# QCSim
Quantum Computing simulator to test concepts.

This project is not ready, but you're invited to take a look.

* `qubit.py` is the module for qubit and register
* `qugate.py` is the module for quantum gates of generic dimensions
* `qccircuits.py` is the script to program quantum circuits (some examples there)
* `app.py` opens an interactive figure to explore manipulations of a single qubit.

Still missing implementations to enable teleportation to happen.
